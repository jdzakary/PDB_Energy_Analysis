## these are the operations involved
DELETE_ATOM 2HZ ## One of the amine hydrogens is now a carbon atom
DELETE_ATOM 3HZ ## Positive charge removed with deprotonation

## Define the added acetyl group
ADD_ATOM  CH  CNH2 CC   0.55  ## Copied from the amide C in Gln
ADD_ATOM  CH3 CH3  CT3  -0.27 ## This is the methyl carbon of the acetyl group...
ADD_ATOM  OH  ONH2 O    -0.55 ## Copied from the amide O in Gln; this is the carboxyl oxygen of the acetyl group
ADD_ATOM HH31 Hapo HA   0.09  ## Methyl hydrogen on the acetyl group; same for HH32 and HH33
ADD_ATOM HH32 Hapo HA   0.09
ADD_ATOM HH33 Hapo HA   0.09

## The acetyl group adds 2 extra chi angles; note that
##   CH3 is used in lieu of OH  because -CH3 is larger than =O
ADD_CHI 5  CD   CE   NZ   CH
ADD_CHI 6  CE   NZ   CH   CH3


## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 31 actual samples from RCSB (unfortunately there aren't many of them
##   when NMR structures and homologues with >70% similarity are excluded):
##   NZ-CH / CH-OH / CH-CH3 bond lengths, CE-NZ-CH / NZ-CH-OH / NZ-CH-CH3 bond angles
##
## The dihedral angle for placing CH and CH3 are set to the mean values of the rotamer bins 
##   with the highest probabilities.
##
## The information for placing 1HZ was based on LYS.params; the 180 degrees used for placing 
##   the OH atom ensures that it is in the same plane as CH, NZ, and CH3.

## Manually define rotamer bins for chis 5 and 6 using data from the 31 samples.
##   Note: The rotamers are listed in the order of decreasing frequency.
##   The percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 6  144.94   9.82   # 9.7%, lower tail of the 179.44 bin

## Strangely, no upper tail was observed. The small sample size might be a factor.
