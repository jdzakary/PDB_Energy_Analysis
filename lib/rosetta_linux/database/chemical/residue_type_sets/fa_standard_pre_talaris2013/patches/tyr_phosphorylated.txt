## fullatom protein phosphorylation patch for tyrosine
## By Andy M. Chen, June 2009, achen39@jhu.edu

NAME phosphorylated
TYPES PHOSPHORYLATION

## general requirements for this patch

BEGIN_SELECTOR
PROPERTY PROTEIN
AA TYR
NOT VARIANT_TYPE PHOSPHORYLATION
NOT VARIANT_TYPE SULFATION ## Just in case
NOT VARIANT_TYPE PROTONATED
NOT VARIANT_TYPE DEPROTONATED
END_SELECTOR

## now we search for a case that matches the residue, take the first one
## so put generic case last

## these are the operations involved
ADD_ATOM  P   Phos X    1.50  ## Best guess from the small molecule ligand params file generator molfile_to_params.py
ADD_ATOM  O1P OOC  OC   -0.78 ## The charge is taken from the free oxygen atoms of the phosphate backbone in DNA residues

ADD_BOND  P   O1P
ADD_BOND  P   O2P
ADD_BOND  P   O3P


## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 128 samples of RCSB's PDB files (with NMR structures and homologues with >70% similarity excluded):
##   OH-P bond length, P-O1P/O2P/O3P bond length, CZ-OH-P bond angle, OH-P-O1P/O2P/O3P bond angle
##   For dihedral angles, O1P is given the anti conformation (180 degrees), 
##     while O2P and O3P are placed in their ideal positions for a tetrahedral configuration.
##
## The dihedral angle for placing P was taken from the mean value of the rotamer bin 
##   with the highest probability.

ADD_PROPERTY CHARGED ## For the phosphate group


## Chi 3 was a proton chi in TYR.params. Since the hydrogen atom isn't there anymore, 
##   redefine chi3 so that its fourth atom is the added P. Then, remove the hydrogen.
REDEFINE_CHI 3  CE2  CZ   OH   P 
DELETE_ATOM HH


## Manually define rotamer bins for chi 3 using data from the 128 samples.
##   Note: The rotamers are listed in the order of decreasing frequency.
##   The percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.
