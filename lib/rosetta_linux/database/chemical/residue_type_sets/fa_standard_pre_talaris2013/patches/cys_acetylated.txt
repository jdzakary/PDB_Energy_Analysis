## now we search for a case that matches the residue, take the first one

## Define the added acetyl group
ADD_ATOM  CD  CNH2 CC   0.55  ## Copied from the amide C in Gln
ADD_ATOM  CE  CH3  CT3  -0.27 ## This is the methyl carbon of the acetyl group...
ADD_ATOM  OCD ONH2 O    -0.55 ## Copied from the amide O in Gln; this is the carboxyl oxygen of the acetyl group
ADD_ATOM 1HE  Hapo HA   0.09  ## Methyl hydrogen on the acetyl group; same for 2HE and 3HE 
ADD_ATOM 2HE  Hapo HA   0.09
ADD_ATOM 3HE  Hapo HA   0.09

## The acetyl group adds one extra chi angle and redefines one; 
##   note that CE is used in lieu of OH because -CH3 is larger than =O

## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 22 actual samples from RCSB (unfortunately there aren't many of them
##   to begin with, plus that NMR structures and homologues with >70% similarity are excluded):
##   SG-CD / CD-OCD / CD-CE bond lengths, CB-SG-CD / SG-CD-OCD / SG-CD-CE bond angles
##
## The dihedral angle for placing CD and CE are set to the mean values of the rotamer bins 
##   with the highest probabilities. The 180 degrees used for placing 
##   the OH atom ensures that it is in the same plane as CD, SG, and CE.

## Manually define rotamer bins for chis 2 and 3 using data from the 31 samples.
##   Note: The rotamers are listed in the order of decreasing frequency.
##   The percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 3  176.91  20.00   # 4.5%

## Note: The last bin consists of a single sample and is thus given an arbitrary standard devitaion of 20.
##   Based on the distribution of the other samples, it appears that this might be either an outlier 
##   or the lower tail of the -132.92 bin. Since 176.91 degrees is close to the anti conformation, however,
##   the data point is kept as a separate bin.
