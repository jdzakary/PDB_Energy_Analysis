## these are the operations involved
DELETE_ATOM 3HZ ## One of the amine hydrogens is now a carbon atom

ADD_ATOM  CM  CH3  CT3   0.12
## Although this is technically an eta carbon, the added carbon is called CM 
##   in some PDB files (for "m"ethylation), 
##
## The 0.12 charge was estimated by comparing the difference between 
##   "C bonded to C and 3 H's" and "C bonded to 2 C's and 2 H's" in existing params files 
##   (-0.27 vs. -0.18) and then applying the 0.09 correction onto the charge 
##   given for the epsilon C of lysine, which is 0.21 (bonded to C, N, and 2 H's)

ADD_ATOM HCM1 Hapo HA  0.09
## Copied from the 1HD1 atom of Ile (hydrogen on primary carbon)

## The methyl group adds an extra chi angle

## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 37 actual samples from RCSB (unfortunately there aren't many of them
##   when NMR structures and homologues with >70% similarity are excluded):
##   NZ-CM bond length, CE-NZ-CM bond angle
##
## The dihedral angle for placing CM was taken from the mean value of the rotamer bin 
##   with the highest probability.
##
##   The information for placing the hydrogens was based on LYS.params.

## Manually define rotamer bins for chi 5 using data from the 37 samples.
##   Note: The rotamers are listed in the order of decreasing frequency.
##   The percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.
