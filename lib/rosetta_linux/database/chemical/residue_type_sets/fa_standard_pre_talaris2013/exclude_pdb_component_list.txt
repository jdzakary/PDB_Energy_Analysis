# This file lists the official PDB Ligand IDs which are
# provided by this residue type set with name3 which match
# the official PDB ligand ID. 
#
# It isn't simply a list of three letter codes that are provided by the Rosetta database,
# or the CCD codes which have Rosetta-equivalent residues.
#
# The principle here is that when reading a from-RCSB structure - with no editing -
# with a residue with one of the following three letter codes, 
# Rosetta should be able to read that residue in correctly with the correct chemical identity.
#
# If Rosetta can read it in but doesn't recognize it as the correct chemical structure,
# or if it could be read in but would require manually changing the three letter code in the PDB,
# or if the three letter code and chemical structure match Rosetta/CCD, but the atom naming conventions don't
# then don't list the code here.
#
# **IF YOU LIST A THREE LETTER CODE HERE, YOU ARE ASSERTING THAT
# EVERYONE WHO LOADS A FROM-RCSB STRUCTURE USING THAT THREE LETTER CODE
# SHOULD BE USING THE ROSETTA-DATABASE-PROVIDED VERSION**
#
# As such, only list a three letter code here if the database residue
# (either params file or patched type) is chemically equivalent to
# the official wwPDB CCD definition for that ligand, with the same atom naming conventions.
#
# Only include entries here if the corresponding Rosetta type 
# is enabled in residue_types.txt 
# (or patches.txt - patches which enable a different IO_STRING for reading are good)
#
# These entries are not whitespace padded.
