NAME oop_pre
TYPES OOP_PRE

## general requirements for this patch

BEGIN_SELECTOR
PROPERTY PROTEIN
NOT VARIANT_TYPE OOP_PRE
NOT VARIANT_TYPE OOP_POST
NOT VARIANT_TYPE UPPER_TERMINUS_VARIANT
NOT VARIANT_TYPE CUTPOINT_UPPER # problems with deleting H because CUTPOINT_UPPER uses H as stub
NOT VARIANT_TYPE N_ACETYLATION # would not have two N mods
NOT AA PRO # only primary amines can be cyclized in OOPs, also tricky to model with 4 bonded N
END_SELECTOR

## now we search for a case that matches the residue, take the first one
## so put generic case last
