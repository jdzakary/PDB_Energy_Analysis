ADD_ATOM  CH1 CH3  CT3   0.12
## Note: the first "CH1" refers to the fact that the added carbon is
##   "eta carbon #1." The CH3 is the atom type (methyl).
## The 0.12 charge was estimated by comparing the difference between 
##   "C bonded to 3 H's" and "C bonded to C and 2 H's" in existing params files 
##   (-0.27 vs. -0.18) and then applying the 0.09 correction onto the charge 
##   given for the epsilon C of lysine, which is 0.21 (bonded to C, N, and 2 H's)

## Note on atom naming by Andy M. Chen:
##
## Technically, the six methyl hydrogens in NMR structures containing dimethyl-lysine ("MLY")
##   are called HH11 through HH23, with the first number indicating which methyl group it's on 
##   and the second indicating which hydrogen of the methyl group it is.
##
##   However, earlier testing shows that using these names may result in oddies if this residue 
##   is further processed by certain molecular visualization applications such as PyMOL
##   due to the second letter not being "H" (for hydrogen). [This occurs because dumped pdb structures 
##   from Rosetta may exclude the element symbol in Column 78-- and as a result, PyMOL would treat HM11, etc.
##   as an atom of the non-existent element "HM," which could cause problems in future processing. 
##   This is confirmed by exporting the file.]
##
##  Hence, HH11 through HH23 are renamed to 1HH through 6HH here. Note that this does have a known negative 
##    side-effect: automatic re-packing of the residue. However, since hydrogens are normally absent in 
##    X-ray crystal structures anyway, this is a minor issue; it would only affect NMR structures, 
##    whose atom positions are calculated rather than determined experimentally anyway.
##    Therefore, I see the atom renaming as the least of two evils.


## The methyl groups add an extra chi angle

## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of 584 data points taken from RCSB's PDB files:
##   NZ-CH1/CH2 bond length, CE-NZ-CH1/CH2 bond angle
##
##
## The dihedral angle for placing CH1 was taken from the mean value of the rotamer bin 
##   with the highest probability.
##
## The following were based on information in LYS.params:
##   Dihedral angle, bond angle, and bond length for the remaining hydrogen
##   Dihedral angle for placing CH2 (120 degrees was meant to maintain the sp3 configuration around NZ)
