## The following were added by Andy M. Chen in July 2009
##   for post-translational modifications
##
##Note: The histidine methylated patch is commented out for now, as it was discovered that
##  Rosetta would try to patch HIS_D as well-- which obviously doesn't work
##  since the hydrogen to be removed isn't there. And since there is no variant code
##  added to HIS_D, I have no way of applying a patch to HIS without affecting HIS_D.
##  The added methyl group otherwise works fine.
##
## Note (from rhiju): I added a TAUTOMER property to HIS_D which would allow its exclusion by the path
##  but I didn't implement yet on his_methylated.
