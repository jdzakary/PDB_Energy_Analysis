## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 97 samples of RCSB's PDB files (with NMR structures and homologues with >70% similarity excluded):
##   OG1-P bond length, P-O1P/O2P/O3P bond length, CB-OG1-P bond angle, OG1-P-O1P/O2P/O3P bond angle
##   For dihedral angles, O1P is given the anti conformation (180 degrees), 
##     while O2P and O3P are placed in their ideal positions for a tetrahedral configuration.
##
## The dihedral angle for placing S was taken from the mean value of the rotamer bin 
##   with the highest probability.

ADD_PROPERTY CHARGED ## For the phosphate group


## Chi 2 was a proton chi in THR.params. Since the hydrogen atom isn't there anymore, 
##   redefine the fourth atom of chi2 to the added P and then remove the hydrogen.

DELETE_ATOM HG1


## Manually define rotamer bins for chi 2 using data from the 97 samples.
##   Note: The rotamers are listed in the order of decreasing frequency.
##   The percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 2  116.72   9.41  #48.5%
ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 2  158.71   7.84  #34.0%, upper tail of the 116.72 bin
ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 2 -102.82  27.09  #10.3%
##The high std. deviation here is intentional, as this is indeed a wide and uncommon distribution
##  (the bin encompasses all phospho-threonine samples with a negative chi2)

ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 2   79.70   7.27  # 7.2%, lower tail of the 116.72 bin
