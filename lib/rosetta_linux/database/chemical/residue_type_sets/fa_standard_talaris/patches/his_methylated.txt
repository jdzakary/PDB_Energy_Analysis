## fullatom protein N(4)-methylation patch for histidine
## By Andy M. Chen, July 2009, achen39@jhu.edu
## Note: This patch does work for regular HIS. However, it will result in a "failed patch" 
##   error message for HIS_D due to the shifted locations of the hydrogens.
##   a possible way to fix this issue is to make HIS_D a TAUTOMER variant of HIS
##   so that two patches could be created, one for HIS and one for HIS_D 
##   (with the selector using the TAUTOMER variant to control which patch goes where).
##   But as things now stand, there's no way to patch only HIS without affecting HIS_D. 
##   Hence, the patch is currently commented out (as of 7/31/2009).
