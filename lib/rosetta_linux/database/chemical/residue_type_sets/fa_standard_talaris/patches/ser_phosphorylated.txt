## fullatom protein phosphorylation patch for serine
## By Andy M. Chen, June 2009, achen39@jhu.edu

NAME phosphorylated
TYPES PHOSPHORYLATION

## general requirements for this patch

BEGIN_SELECTOR
PROPERTY PROTEIN
NAME3 SER DSE
NOT VARIANT_TYPE PHOSPHORYLATION ## Don't phosphorylate a residue twice
END_SELECTOR

## now we search for a case that matches the residue, take the first one
## so put generic case last

## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 155 samples of RCSB's PDB files (with the NMR structures and homologues with >70% similarity excluded):
##   OG-P bond length, P-O1P/O2P/O3P bond length, CB-OG-P bond angle, OG-P-O1P/O2P/O3P bond angle
##   For dihedral angles, O1P is given the anti conformation (180 degrees), 
##     while O2P and O3P are placed in their ideal positions for a tetrahedral configuration.
##
## The dihedral angle for placing P was taken from the mean value of the rotamer bin 
##   with the highest probability.

ADD_PROPERTY CHARGED ## For the phosphate group


## Chi 2 was a proton chi in SER.params. Since the hydrogen atom isn't there anymore, 
##   redefine the fourth atom of chi2 to the added P and then remove the hydrogen.

## Manually define rotamer bins for chi 2 using data from the 155 samples.
##   Note: The rotamers are listed in the order of decreasing frequency.
##   The percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding or exclusion of outliers.
