## Note on atom naming by Andy M. Chen:
##
## Technically, the carboxyl oxygens in most files containing gamma-carboxy-glutamate ("CGU")
##   are called OE11/12 for the first carboxyl group and OE21/22 for the second carboxyl group.
##   However, earlier testing shows that using the names OE21 and OE22 may result in 
##   oddies when displaying this residue in certain molecular visualization application such as PyMOL
##   (e.g. missing bonds or oxygen showing up as white atoms) due to the second letter not being 
##   "O" (for oxygen). [This occurs because dumped pdb structures from Rosetta may exclude the element symbol 
##   in Column 78-- and as a result, PyMOL would treat OE21, etc. as atoms of the non-existent element "Oe,"
##   which could cause problems in future processing. This is confirmed by exporting the file.]
##
##  Hence, OE21/22 are renamed to OE3/4 here. Note that this does have a known negative side-effect:
##    automatic re-packing of the residue upon loading a CGU-containing residue for the first time
##    would be inevitable (unless, of course, a global find/replace on the PDB file in advance to 
##    rename the atoms). But even if the naming convention of OE21/22 didn't suffer from the possibility 
##    of not being identified as oxygens, there is another problem: three atoms of the first carboxyl group
##    are also renamed in CGU. Namely, CD is now CD1, OE1 is now OE11, and OE2 is now OE12.
##
##  [Renaming the 3 atoms that exist in regular glutamate is certainly an option, but currently this 
##    can only be done by adding new atoms, redefining the chi angles, and then deleting the old atoms--
##    which would also force automatic re-packing. Therefore, I see the OE3/OE4 solution as the least of two evils.]
##


## The carboxyl group adds an extra chi angle
ADD_CHI 4  CB   CG   CD2   OE3 


## Use the data from GLU.params to re-pack the atoms around CG:
## CD is kept in place, while CD2 is placed using the torsion 
##   and bond angles originally meant for placing 1HG. (This approximation 
##   is applied because the sp3 geometry around CG is not expected 
##   to change significantly when one C-H bond is replaced by a C-C bond.)
##
## The CG-CD2 bond length is the arithmetic mean of 210 data points taken from RCSB's PDB files. 
##   (with NMR structures and homologues with a similarity >70% excluded). 
##   Finally, 1HG is placed where 2HG was in GLU.params.

SET_ICOOR  CD2 123.926323  66.551559  1.520  CG   CB   CD 
SET_ICOOR 1HG  118.538139  76.395332  1.089  CG   CB   CD2


## Place the two oxygens of the added carboxyl group 
##   using information from crystal structures. Again, the average value of the 
##   CG-CD-OE bond angles and CD-OE bond lengths from actual PDB files are used here.
##
## The dihedral angle for placing OE3 was taken from the mean value of the bin
##   with the highest frequency. The 180 degrees used for OE4 is meant to 
##   generate ideal geometry around the sp2 carbon CG.

SET_ICOOR  OE3  -69.57  61.71  1.250  CD2   CG   CB 
SET_ICOOR  OE4  180.00  61.71  1.250  CD2   CG   OE3


SET_ATOM_TYPE CG CH1
SET_MM_ATOM_TYPE CG CT1
SET_ATOMIC_CHARGE CG -0.19
## Was -0.28, but one C-H bond was replaced with a C-C bond (net +0.09)


## Manually define rotamer bins for chi 4 using data from the 210 samples.
##   Note: The rotamers are listed in the order of decreasing frequency.
##   The percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.
ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 4  -69.57  15.09  #28.1% 
ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 4  -16.69  11.05  #18.1%, lower half of the bi-modal distribution around 0 degrees
ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 4   24.22  15.39  #17.6%, upper half of the bi-modal distribution around 0 degrees 
ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 4 -160.56  10.60  #17.1%, upper half of the bi-modal distribution around +/- 180 degrees
ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 4  161.66  10.87  #11.9%, lower half of the bi-modal distribution around +/- 180 degrees
ADD_CHI_ROTAMER 4  110.41   9.08  # 2.9%
## The 110.41 bin was included despite the appearance of an outlier because of symmetry in the carboxyl group: 
##   namely, one can rotate the CG-CD bond by 180 degrees without changing the chemistry at all. 
##   Since 110.41-180 = -69.59, this merits its inclusion.
