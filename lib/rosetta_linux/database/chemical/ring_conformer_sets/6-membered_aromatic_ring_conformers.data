# A list of ring conformation definitions for six-membered rings.

# nu1 is defined using only internal ring atoms, so for a ring of all carbons,
# nu1 is the C6-C1-C2-C3 angle.

# Since these are internal ring torsions, the sum must be 0 degrees.

# tau1 is defined as the internal ring bond angle about C1, so for a ring of all
# carbons, tau1 is the C6-C1-C2 angle.

# Degeneracy is the number of copies to load into a degenerate conformer set.
# It does not apply for a set with one conformer.

# Degeneracy is the number of copies to load into a degenerate conformer set.

# q is in Angstroms; phi and theta are in degrees.  However, these values are
# meaningless for a planar aromatic system.

# There is only 1 possible ring conformer for an aromatic ring system.
