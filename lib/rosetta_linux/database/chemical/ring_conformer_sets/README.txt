This directory contains definition files for ideal ring conformations for the
various ring sizes.

Files in this directory should be named #-membered_ring_conformers.data, where
# is the ring size.

Currently, the RingConformerSet system only works with monocyclic, saturated
ring systems.

Conformer nomenclature is explained in Cremer & Pople (1974) JACS, 97(6),
1354-8.

More details about database file format are provided in the comments for those
files.
