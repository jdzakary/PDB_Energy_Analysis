# A list of ring conformation definitions for five-membered rings.

# Conformer nomenclature is explained in French & Dowd (1994) J. Comp. Chem.,
# 15(5), 561-70 and Cremer & Pople (1974) JACS, 97(6), 1354-8.

# The following describes a carbohydrate system, as an example, but the system
# is general for any monocyclic, saturated five-atom ring.

# In general, numbers (or the letter O) represent ring position.  Three atoms
# are found for the conformer in question that form a plane, and the atoms are
# arranged in a clockwise fashion from oxygen (O).  Numbers (or O) given before
# the symbol, (which are also superscripted if the font allows,) indicate atoms
# that are above the plane.  Subscripted numbers (or O) to the right of the
# symbol indicate atoms below the plane.

#         O
#   nu4 /   \ nu0
#     /       \
#   C4          C1
#    \         /
# nu3 \       / nu1
#      C3----C2
#        nu2

# For example, if a plane can be formed with atoms O, C3, and C4, in the ex-
# ample above and if C1 and C2 are above and below that plane, respectively, it
# is the 1T2 conformer.

# It should be noted that the specific names here are for aldoses.  Ketoses
# will have different labels, since C1 is exocyclic.

# We only need 4 torsion angles to define a 5-membered conformer, so only the
# 1st 4 nu values will be stored in Rosetta.  However, all 5 angles are listed
# here for completeness.

# nu1 is defined using only internal ring atoms, so in the above example, nu1 is
# the O-C1-C2-C3 angle.

# Since these are internal ring torsions, the sum must be 0 degrees.

# It is impossible to form the more strained ring conformers without also ex-
# periencing bond angle distortion.  Thus, the table below SHOULD include ideal
# tau (internal bond angle) designations for each conformer.  HOWEVER, IT DOES
# NOT, because they have not been calculated yet!

# tau1 is defined as the internal ring bond angle about C1, so in the above ex-
# ample, tau1 is the O-C1-C2 angle.

# Technically, a strained ring should experience exocyclic bond angle distor-
# tions as well.  It is strongly recommended that minimizations of both bond
# angles and bond lengths are performed after any ring conformation move.

# Degeneracy is the number of copies to load into a degenerate conformer set.
# It only applies for larger ring sizes.

# Note that phi OR at least 2 nu angles give all the information one
# needs to assign the specific ideal ring conformer.  q OR the inclusion of
# bond angles and bond lengths are required to give the exact, actual conformer.
# As such, q here is essentially meaningless.  Realistic q values tend to range
# from 0.3 to ???.  The number 0.4 is used throughout this table, but it should
# be understood that it is essentially a placeholder.

# q is in Angstroms; phi is in degrees.

# There are 20 possible ring conformers.
