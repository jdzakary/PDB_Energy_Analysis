# A list of ring sizes to the morphemes used in carbohydrate nomenclature.
# Both the morpheme for the full name and the standard 1-letter abbreviation
# are provided.

# A map of pairs is created from this data for which the first element is the
# 1-letter code and the second element is the full morpheme.  For example, a
# 6-membered ring has the 1-letter code -p- affixed to the 3-letter code before
# the affixes for any modifications, such as NAc.  The same 6-membered ring is
# named as a pyranose, so the morpheme is -opyran-, and a 6-membered-ring
# glucose is a glucopyranose (Glcp) while a 6-membered-ring glucosamine is a
# glucopyranosamine (GlcpN).

# Note that smaller rings do not have accepted 1-letter affixes.  This table
# lists them as X, but this will be interpreted as a null char when read in.
