# The phi, psi, and omega values listed here are for the non-reducing-end
# residue (the leftmost residue in the table below), in all cases.

# Note that for glycosidic linkages, phi, psi, and omega go upstream (toward
# the LOWER_TERMINUS, or reducing end) and not the other way around.  That is,
# the non-reducing-end residue is numbered after the reducing-end residue in
# the sequence.

# The main-chain designation of the non-reducing-end residue has no effect on
# the torsion values.  Likewise, the anomeric designation of the reducing-end
# residue has no effect on the values.

# For peptide-glycan N-linkages, psi is equivalent to ASN's chi3 (the peptide
# bond, omega1 is equivalent to its chi2, and omega2 to chi1.

# IF ADDING NEW ROWS, please sort them such that higher population conformers
# come first.

# reducing-end_res is the lower-numbered residue, while non-reducing-end_res is
# the higher-numbered residued, which is attached to the lower-numbered
# residue.  This ordering from right to left matches IUPAC ordering of chains.
