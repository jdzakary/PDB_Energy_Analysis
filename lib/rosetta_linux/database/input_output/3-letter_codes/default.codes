# A list of custom 3-letter codes for residues and their Rosetta equivalents.
# This file is for use as a template.

# To add custom 3-letter codes, either modify this list and use the flag
# -alternate_3_letter_codes custom.codes
# or create your own *.codes file in database/input_output/3-letter_codes/

# CODES ARE CASE-SENSITIVE!

# This one is a bit of a bummer. SMP and RMP have the same PDB atom names.
# This means that we will only ever successfully match one even if we create
# another residue type. Maybe we could detect it (correct per-stereocenter 
# assignment feels a long way off though).
