# A list of custom 3-letter codes for residues and their Rosetta equivalents.
# This file is primarily used for unit testing and as an example, but it would
# work as advertised if someone really wanted sentence-case amino acid residue
# 3-letter codes in their PDB files for some bizarro reason.

# To allow these codes, use the options flag
# -alternate_3_letter_codes lower_case.codes

# (This file is used in unit testing; do not modify without changing the unit
# test accordingly!)
