Version OLF_params_8s
Uses the new parameterization of the AHD polynomial where the polynomial is a function of the angle
instead of being a function of the cosine of the angle.

NOTES: 2012/03/13
Trying once again to revamp the AHD polynomial for bb/bb contacts.  Will also try to revamp the polynomial for ASP/ARG contacts, in a bit.
Derived from OLF_params_8h.

Generated HBond parameters by Matthew O'Meara in 2010


Adjusting hydrogen bond potentials for hydroxyl donors (newOH_params)
New OH potentials:
These are modeled off of the poly_AHdist_4 potential just shifted closer
poly_AHdist_4 has a peak at 1.902
poly_AHdist_dOH_1 has a peak at 1.735
poly_AHdist_dOH_2 has a peak at 1.753
poly_AHdist_dOH_3 has a peak at 1.84
AHX donors with PBA, HXL, CXA or CXL acceptors have polynomial poly_AHdist_dOH_1
HXL donors with PBA, AHX, HXL, CXA or CXL acceptors and dAHXaAHX have polynomial poly_AHdist_dOH_2
AHX or HXL donors to IMD or IME acceptors have polynomial poly_AHdist_dOH_3 

For each hydrogen bond class that uses the new OH parameters, shift
the fading functions in closer as well.
