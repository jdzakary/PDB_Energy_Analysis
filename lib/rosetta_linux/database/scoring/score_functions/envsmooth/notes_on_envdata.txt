The envdata tables are formatted as whitespace-separated fields, organized as follows:
20 rows for the 20 canonical residue types, such that the row number corresponds with the int representation of the residue type in chemical::AA.
40 columns representing "environment" bins, corresponding to the number of heavy-atom neighbors (between 0 and 39) within 10A of a residue's neighbor atom.

For example: 
	An alanine (row 1) with 5 nighboring atoms (column 6) would look up a value of +1.30 in envdata.txt.

Finally, note that the score provided in the table is multiplied by a factor of 2.019 when applied in Rosetta energy units.
