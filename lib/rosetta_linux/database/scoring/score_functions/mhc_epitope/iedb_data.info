The database was then used to generate iedb_data.db using the following command:
mhc_data_db.py --iedb_mysql <LOCAL_MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME> --mysql_user <LOCAL_MYSQL_USERNAME> --mysql_pw <LOCAL_MYSQL_PASSWORD> --allele_set hlaII --assay_mhc_ligand_binding all --assay_mhc_ligand_elution all --cores all --db iedb_data.db --overwrite
(Values in <> are suppressed to protect the user's local mysql credentials.)

A rudimentary check has been made to ensure that a valid database file has been generated.
It should be safe to commit the updated database (ALONG WITH THIS FILE) to the Rosetta GitHub
repository.  Before doing so, make sure that unit test core:MHCEpitopeEnergySetupTests_initialization:test_iedb_database_integrity passes.

Any unit test failures should be carefully checked to make sure that they are caused by
changes in the database, and not a corrupt database.  Such occurrences should be very rare,
but not impossible.
