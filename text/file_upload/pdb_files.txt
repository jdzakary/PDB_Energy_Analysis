PDB files need to adhere to specific formatting rules in order for the tools to work correctly. Namely,
they should be renumbered so that the first residue in the sequence is at position 1 and there are no
gaps in numbering. Additionally, there should not be any other excess information contained in the file.
The PDB files should only contain ATOM records, which also means that multichain structures are
not supported.
